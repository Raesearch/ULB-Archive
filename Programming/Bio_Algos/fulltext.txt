As discussed in the session on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, keyword trees provide an efficient solution to search for multiple k patterns in a text of length n. The algorithm requires first the construction of a keyword tree and then, using na√Øve threading, the patterns can be identified in O(nm), where n is the average length of the k patterns and m is the length of the text.
Alfred Aho and Margaret Corasick proposed in 1975 a more efficient solution that allows one to identify the patterns in O(m) time. To achieve this improvement, the keyword tree is replaced by a finite state pattern matching automata. Once this machine is constructed, the text can be processed and the starting positions for the different patterns can be returned as output.
The full specification of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is provided in the original article included with this assignment.
